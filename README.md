# My first Data Engineering Project

I wanted to est my skills on python, such as learning how to use Apache Airflow.

The project itself uses Spotify API to get last listened songs, making a ETL process and finally inserteing them into a SQLite databse.

Also using AirFlow to schedule daily process.

_Spotify URL to get api-key_: _https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/_
